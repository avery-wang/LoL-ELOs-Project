# LoL-ELOs-Project
## Freiwald Scholars Project, Summer 2023
### By Avery Wang
This is a collection of all of the code and CSV files used in my project for the Freiwald Scholars Program in Summer 2023.
## CSV Files
The files titled `[Year]_LoL_esports_match_data_from_OraclesElixir.csv` are the raw files downloaded from [Oracle's Elixir](https://oracleselixir.com/tools/downloads). They were downloaded on June 9, 2023, but in a future version, these may be redownloaded daily so that match data remains up-to-date.
